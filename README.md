# IGFollowersIncreaser ü§ñ

With this script the user by simply logging in, can increase their followers !
Works for both private and public accounts.
And the first time the user uses it can add up to 50 followers ! The other times it can add 25 - 30 followers.
It's suggested to use it every two (2) days in order for your account not to get blocked.
Also it provides additional information such as: the number of followers added, the percentage of success / failure etc.

### Question 3

### Question 4

- Can my account get blocked by using this script ?

Answer ‚û°Ô∏è Only if you're using a very old version of Instagram. But the script has been tested in several accounts and none of them got blocked.
